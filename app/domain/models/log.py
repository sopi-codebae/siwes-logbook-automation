    Represents a single day's SIWES activity record. This is the core
    entity of the system, supporting offline creation with eventual
    synchronization via client_uuid for idempotency.
    
    The 25-week SIWES period consists of approximately 125 working days
    (5 days/week × 25 weeks). Each day requires one log entry.
    
    Attributes:
        id: Server-generated unique identifier (UUID).
        client_uuid: Client-generated UUID for offline sync idempotency.
        student_id: Foreign key to User (student who created log).
        placement_id: Foreign key to IndustrialPlacement.
        log_date: Date of the logged activity (must be within SIWES period).
        week_number: Week number (1-25) within SIWES period.
        activity_description: Detailed description of daily activities.
        latitude: GPS latitude where log was created (nullable).
        longitude: GPS longitude where log was created (nullable).
        distance_from_geofence: Calculated distance from geofence center (meters).
        location_status: Result of geofence validation.
        status: Current lifecycle status of the log.
        created_offline_at: Timestamp when created offline (nullable).
        synced_at: Timestamp when synced to server (nullable).
        reviewed_at: Timestamp when reviewed by supervisor (nullable).
        reviewer_id: Foreign key to User (supervisor who reviewed).
        reviewer_comment: Supervisor's review comments (nullable).
        student: Related StudentProfile entity.
        placement: Related IndustrialPlacement entity.
        reviewer: Related SupervisorProfile entity.
    
    Example:
        >>> log = DailyLog(
        ...     id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        ...     client_uuid=str(uuid.uuid4()),

        ...     log_date=date(2026, 1, 24),
        ...     week_number=3,
        ...     activity_description="Learned database design and normalization",
        ...     latitude=6.5244,
        ...     longitude=3.3792

    Note:
        - client_uuid ensures idempotent sync (prevents duplicates)
        - Logs become immutable after status reaches VERIFIED or FLAGGED
        - Location data may be null if permission denied or unavailable
        - week_number is calculated from log_date and SIWES start date
        - One log per date per student (enforced at service layer)
