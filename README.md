## 📖 Overview

The **SIWES Logbook Automation System** addresses three critical problems in the current Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) management:

### 1. **The Verification Gap** (Geographical Accountability)
**Problem**: Supervisors cannot verify if students are actually at their workplace, leading to "ghosting" or "back-filling" of logs from home.

**Solution**: **Geofencing** captures GPS coordinates at the moment of entry, ensuring data is only valid if the student is physically within the company's designated radius.

### 2. **Administrative Latency** (Communication Bottlenecks)
**Problem**: Traditional paper logbooks create a "black hole" where supervisors have zero visibility into student progress for months.

**Solution**: **Real-time Chat and Video Consultation** eliminate wait time between student queries and supervisor responses, allowing immediate intervention.

### 3. **Network Instability and Data Loss** (The "Offline" Problem)
**Problem**: Standard web applications fail in remote industrial sites with poor network coverage, forcing students to revert to paper.

**Solution**: **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with Service Workers stays functional without internet. Students save logs to local cache (IndexedDB), and the system automatically syncs to the database when network is restored.
